## Day 1-3: Core Concepts and Classes
### Topics:
- Objects, Classes, and Instances.
- Java class structure and components.

### Practice:
- Create a `Person` class with attributes like name and age.
- Instantiate and interact with `Person` objects.

---

## Day 4-5: Object Relationships
### Topics:
- **Inheritance**: Sharing properties and methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and dynamic dispatch.
- **Encapsulation**: Access modifiers and data hiding.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and methods.

### Practice:
- Implement a `Vehicle` class and derive `Car` and `Bike` subclasses.
- Add methods to `Car` to increase and decrease speed.

---

## Day 6-7: Interfaces and Abstract Classes
### Topics:
- Difference between interfaces and abstract classes.
- How to implement multiple interfaces.

### Practice:
- Create a `PaymentMethod` interface.
- Implement the interface in `CreditCard` and `BankCard` classes.

---

## Day 8-10: Collections and Exceptions
### Topics:
- Java Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, and Maps.
- Exception handling: `try-catch`, `throw`, `throws`.

### Practice:
- Build a product management system with features to add, update, and delete products.
- Implement custom exceptions for invalid product prices.

---

## Day 11-12: File Handling
### Topics:
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Classes: `File`, `FileWriter`, and `FileReader`.

### Practice:
- Write a program to save user data to a file.
- Load and display user data from the file.

---

## Day 13-14: Advanced Concepts
### Topics:
- **Multithreading**: Using threads for parallel tasks.
- **Lambda Expressions** and **Stream API**.

### Practice:
- Create a task management system using threads.
- Filter and process a list of data using streams.

---

## Day 15: Build a Comprehensive Project
### Project:
- Combine learned concepts to create a fully functional program.
- Example: **E-Commerce Cart System**:
  - Add, remove, and update cart items.
  - Calculate the total price.
  - Implement different payment methods using interfaces.

---

## Suggested Projects

### Easy:
1. **Calculator Application**:
   - Basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
   - Error handling for invalid inputs.
2. **Student Management System**:
   - Add, view, and update student records.

### Intermediate:
1. **Library Management System**:
   - Add, lend, and return books.
   - Save data to a file.
2. **Appointment Scheduler**:
   - Manage appointments with conflict checks.

### Advanced:
1. **E-Commerce Cart System**:
   - Use OOP principles to manage products, cart items, and payment processing.
